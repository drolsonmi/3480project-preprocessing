# Class Project: Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
__MATH 3480__: Machine Learning

## Project Overview
A survey was completed to examine the mental health of teenagers and young adults. The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive data preprocessing on the *young-people-survey-responses* dataset to prepare it for predicting loneliness in young people.

**Submission Format:** Submit a **written report** (PDF or Word document) that includes all deliverables, code snippets, figures with captions, and documentation of your preprocessing decisions.

---

## Report Structure and Requirements

Your report should include:
- **Code snippets**: Relevant code illustrating key steps (not your entire notebook)
- **Figures and visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and tables at readable sizes
- **Figure captions**: Descriptive captions for every figure
- **Explanations**: Clear documentation of steps and justifications for decisions
- **Results**: Outcomes of each preprocessing step with statistics or summaries

---

## Part 1: Data Loading and Initial Exploration

### Deliverables:

1. **Dataset Overview**
   - Report dimensions (rows × columns)
   - Table showing first 5-10 rows
   - Summary of data types

2. **Initial Data Quality**
   - Identify the target variable (what we are trying to predict)
   - Summary table of missing values per column

***Suggested* Figures:** Sample data table, target distribution bar chart

---

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Important Note:** EDA and preprocessing are iterative processes done side-by-side. You need EDA to understand what preprocessing is required, and you need preprocessing to properly analyze some variables. You may find yourself moving back and forth between Parts 2 and 3.

### Deliverables:

1. **Univariate Analysis**
   - For **numerical variables**: Include histograms or box plots for key variables
   - For **categorical variables**: Include bar charts showing frequency distributions for key variables
   - Caption each figure noting important observations (skewness, outliers, imbalanced categories, etc.)
   - Identify which variables have distributions that may require special handling

2. **Relationship to Target Variable (Bivariate Analysis)**
   - Create visualizations exploring the relationship between important variables and the target (loneliness)
   - For **numerical predictors**: Use box plots, violin plots, or scatter plots grouped by target
   - For **categorical predictors**: Use grouped bar charts or stacked bar charts
   - Caption each figure explaining what relationship (if any) you observe

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Create a correlation heatmap for numerical variables
   - Identify highly correlated variable pairs (correlation > 0.7 or < -0.7)
   - Discuss potential multicollinearity concerns
   - Note which variables appear most correlated with the target

4. **Key Findings Summary**
   - Write 1-2 paragraphs summarizing your most important findings:
     - Which variables appear most predictive of loneliness?
     - Which variables show little to no relationship with the target?
     - Are there any surprising relationships?
     - What preprocessing concerns did you identify (outliers, skewness, etc.)?

**Suggested Figures:** 
- Histograms/box plots of key numerical variables
- Bar charts of key categorical variables
- Box plots or violin plots showing variable distributions by target class
- Correlation heatmap
- Scatter plots for interesting relationships

**Note:** This EDA will inform your preprocessing decisions in Part 3. For example:
- High correlation between variables may lead you to remove redundant features
- Severely skewed distributions may affect your imputation method choice
- Variables showing no relationship to the target may be candidates for removal
